Project Timeline
================

An HTML template for online project timelines.

This timeline was based off of Brad Frost's, from [his article on 24ways.org](http://24ways.org/2013/project-hubs/).

## What is a project timeline and why would I use one?
A project timeline is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design project. The timeline lives online (either publically available or password protected), so that everyone involved in the team has access to it.

The benefits of using a project timeline:
- Serves as a centralized hub for the project
- Easily and visually view project progress
- Provides an archive for project artifacts
- Keep clients and team members up to speed with design progress
- Lives at a URL that doesn't change
